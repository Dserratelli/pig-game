A competitive game between two players who roll a 6 sided die to be the first one to reach 100 points. Dice rolls are logged as scores and either added together or held on to allowing the next player to have a turn. If a 1 is rolled the players current score goes to 0 and the opposing player is granted a turn. Numbers 2-6 can be held adding to players total score. All of these functions were made possible with javascript.
